I have put all of the following maps into a fslr_32k(HCP) cifti file, parcellated at 400 regions.
I have also put the mean value in a .csv for easy analysis.


T1w/T2w Ratio (Glasser): https://balsa.wustl.edu/mpwM
Original is in fslr_32k, parcellated

Functional Connectivity Principal Gradient (Margulies et al. 2016 PNAS): https://github.com/PennLINC/Brain_Organization/tree/master/PrincipleGradient
Original is in fslr_32k, parcellated

Evolutionary Hierarchy (Hill et al 2010): https://github.com/PennLINC/Brain_Organization/tree/master/EvolutionaryExpansion
Original is in left hemisphere fsaverage, which I mapped to fslr_32k, mirrored to the right hemisphere, and parcellated.

Evolutionary Expansion (new, Xu 2020); https://github.com/TingsterX/alignment_macaque-human/tree/main/area_expansion
Original is in fslr_32k, parcellated.

Allometric Scaling, PNC (Reardon et al 2018 Science): https://github.com/PennLINC/Brain_Organization/tree/master/AllometricScaling
Original is in fsaverage5, which I mapped to fslr_32k, and parcellated.

Cortical Thickness HCP: https://balsa.wustl.edu/w8PM

Cerebral Blood Flow (Satterthwaite et al 2014 PNAS): https://github.com/PennLINC/Brain_Organization/tree/master/MeanCBF
Original is in fsaverage5, which I mapped to fslr_32k, and parcellated.
